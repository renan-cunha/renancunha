I am an undergraduate student of computer ccience at the Universidade
Federal do Pará. Since February-2018, I work in LabVIS-FalaBrasil
with deep learning applied to speech synthesis. My main interests are artificial intelligence,
machine learning, natural language processing and software 
engineering.
