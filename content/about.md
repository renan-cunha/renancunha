Hi, I am Renan Cunha, a Computer Scientist from Par√°, a state in northern Brazil. 
I made this blog to learn and write more, two things I really enjoy doing. 
Most of the stuff I write here is work-related, but sometimes I can end up on weird and unexpected topics.

My main interests that intersect with my work (and between themselves) are AI and Data Science. 
My interest in AI started because I became fascinated by the intelligent behavior that was starting to be performed by
machines, and that motivated me to build software that had this kind of complexity. 
My interest in Data Science emerged due to the enormous curiosity I have for the world, 
seeking to understand it and make justified decisions based on the available evidence.

Outside of work, I am interested a lot in Philosophy. 
Even though it is [***considered a field without much progress***](https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAWIT-15) (this is
[***debatable***](https://philpapers.org/rec/HUEALR-2)), I find myself amused by many of the questions that philosophers ask:

* *Does the metaphysical exist?*
* *What is the right thing to do? (is there even such a thing as "the right thing to do"?)*
* [***How do we know if we can trust the evidence we see?***](https://philpapers.org/rec/HUESTA)
* [***What makes you you?***](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html)
* [***How to live the best life possible?***](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/02/what-is-stoicism-and-how-can-it-turn-your-life-to-solid-gold/)
* [***How do you define consciousness?***](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-chalmers-nature-ethics-consciousness/)

I think all kids ask themselves these questions, and I don't understand why most people stop asking that at some point in life.

Also, I am sympathetic with the [***Effective Altruism movement***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc), 
which aims to do the most good given the resources we have. 
The EA movement ties together empathy with rationality. The goal is to use evidence and reason
to figure out which ways to do good are the most effective. 
You'd be surprised that, through this lens, working on [***AI might be more effective at doing good than, say, trying to solve global warming***](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).

Having all these interests and cool things to work with, I am grateful for the simple fact that I am alive. 
It's fascinating to stop for a few minutes and realize that you're [***experiencing
something***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14&vl), 
that your senses are picking up information, and you're actually *perceiving* in the first person. 
Because of that, I find it easy to see meaning in the most mundane tasks, 
and I think it's a sin to live without [***giving it your all***](https://thestoicsage.com/how-to-succeed-in-everything-you-do-a-stoic-guide/).

Besides all that, I like bicycles. 
It is an effective way to move from point A to point B while exercising and getting sunlight. 
I love my [***cat***](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgqtUjAu2g) and playing with her, although she can leave some scars :( and
I think animes and games are the ultimate art. 
Blame them for so beautifully combining [***stunning visuals***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurren_Lagann),
[***immersive soundtracks***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akame_ga_Kill!), and 
[***heart-warming stories***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)).
